# BID CALCULATOR

[View demo !](bid-calculator.m4v)

## What can be improved

* Add more love on the UI/UX
* Switch frontend for anything else (Vuejs, React, etc.)
* More unit tests (Enums, controller, End2End)
* Create specific Request object
* Use backend proxy action to call the calculator and secure the API KEY token
* Use method options() of enums to pupulate the select in the form
* Break frontend and backend apps apart completely since they are in the same apps in this MVP.
